;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file defines dynamic completion hooks for shell-mode and
;; shell-command prompts that are based on bash completion.
;;
;; Bash completion for emacs:
;; - is aware of bash builtins, aliases and functions
;; - does file expansion inside of colon-separated variables
;;   and after redirections (> or <)
;; - escapes special characters when expanding file names
;; - is configurable through programmable bash completion
;;
;; When the first completion is requested in shell model or a shell
;; command, bash-completion.el starts a separate bash
;; process.  Bash-completion.el then uses this process to do the actual
;; completion and includes it into Emacs completion suggestions.
;;
;; A simpler and more complete alternative to bash-completion.el is to
;; run a bash shell in a buffer in term mode(M-x `ansi-term').
;; Unfortunately, many Emacs editing features are not available when
;; running in term mode.  Also, term mode is not available in
;; shell-command prompts.
;;
;; Bash completion can also be run programmatically, outside of a
;; shell-mode command, by calling
;; `bash-completion-dynamic-complete-nocomint'
;;
;; INSTALLATION
;;
;; 1. copy bash-completion.el into a directory that's on Emacs load-path
;; 2. add this into your .emacs file:
;;   (autoload 'bash-completion-dynamic-complete \"bash-completion\"
;;     \"BASH completion hook\")
;;   (add-hook 'shell-dynamic-complete-functions
;;      'bash-completion-dynamic-complete)
;;
;;   or simpler, but forces you to load this file at startup:
;;
;;   (require 'bash-completion)
;;   (bash-completion-setup)
;;
;; 3. reload your .emacs (M-x `eval-buffer') or restart
;;
;; Once this is done, use <TAB> as usual to do dynamic completion from
;; shell mode or a shell command minibuffer, such as the one started
;; for M-x `compile'. Note that the first completion is slow, as emacs
;; launches a new bash process.
;;
;; You'll get better results if you turn on programmable bash completion.
;; On Ubuntu, this means running:
;;   sudo apt-get install bash-completion
;; and then adding this to your .bashrc:
;;   . /etc/bash_completion
;;
;; Right after enabling programmable bash completion, and whenever you
;; make changes to you .bashrc, call `bash-completion-reset' to make
;; sure bash completion takes your new settings into account.
;;
;; Loading /etc/bash_completion often takes time, and is not necessary
;; in shell mode, since completion is done by a separate process, not
;; the process shell-mode process.
;;
;; To turn off bash completion when running from emacs but keep it on
;; for processes started by bash-completion.el, add this to your .bashrc:
;; if [[ ( -z "$INSIDE_EMACS" || "$EMACS_BASH_COMPLETE" = "t" ) &&\
;;      -f /etc/bash_completion ]]; then
;;   . /etc/bash_completion
;; fi
;;
;; Emacs sets the environment variable INSIDE_EMACS to the processes
;; started from it. Processes started by bash-completion.el have
;; the environment variable EMACS_BASH_COMPLETE set to t.
;;
;; CAVEATS
;;
;; Using a separate process for doing the completion has several
;; important disadvantages:
;; - bash completion is slower than standard emacs completion
;; - the first completion can take a long time, since a new bash process
;;   needs to be started and initialized
;; - the separate process is not aware of any changes made to bash
;;   in the current buffer.
;;   In a standard terminal, you could do:
;;     $ alias myalias=ls
;;     $ myal<TAB>
;;   and bash would propose the new alias.
;;   Bash-completion.el cannot do that, as it is not aware of anything
;;   configured in the current shell. To make bash-completion.el aware
;;   of a new alias, you need to add it to .bashrc and restart the
;;   completion process using `bash-completion-reset'.
;;
;; COMPATIBILITY
;;
;; bash-completion.el is known to work with Bash 3 and 4, on Emacs,
;; starting with version 24.1, under Linux and OSX. It does not work
;; on XEmacs.

This method returns a list of tokens found between START and END,

The string in a token is an unescaped version of the token.  For

`bash-completion-tokenize-append-str'.

The range is a cons containing the start and end position of the
token (start . end).  Start is the position of the first character
that belongs to the token.  End is the position of the first
character that doesn't belong to the token.  For example in the
string \" hello world \", the first token range is (2 . 7) and
the second token range (9 . 14). It can be accessed using
